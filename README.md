3D Print a comb attachment replacement

Me and my wife have been in grooming for more than a decade, and if you have been in it that long.
You have broken a comb attachment.  This is a printable replacement.

Currently this is just a #2 comb, but if you would like to change which comb it is.
All you have to do is alter the "points".
